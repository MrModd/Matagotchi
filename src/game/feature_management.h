/* Every feature has to implement 3 methods:
 *
 * void init_<FEATURE>(struct GameState *game_state, uint32_t current_timestamp)
 *   Initializes the feature variables inside the @game_state.
 *   The feature may needs the last update of the params, it can use @current_timestamp
 *   as init value.
 *
 * void check_<FEATURE>(const struct GameState *game_state, uint32_t current_timestamp, struct GameEvents *game_events)
 *   Verifies if at @current_timestamp there are updates to do to the params of the feature.
 *   It should use the @game_state only as reference. It should update @game_events instead
 *   to notify eventual updates to apply.
 *
 * bool apply_<FEATURE>(struct GameState *game_state, struct GameEvents game_events)
 *   Applies the updates calculated by the previous function and passed here by @game_events
 *   to the @game_state.
 *   @return: true if changes have been made to @game_state, false otherwise
